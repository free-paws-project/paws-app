# paws-app
Holds the PAWS app core functionality.

This app aims to create a Pet Adoption WebApp Suite (PAWS) for nonprofit animal adoption organizations.

Goals for this app are to be able to:
* Enter/edit/maintain animal info
* Enter/edit/maintain people info (volunteers, fosters, adoptive families)
* Store communications with fosters & volunteers
* Track data, such as avg # of days animals are in the org/ # days to adoption, avg cost per animal, etc.

There's a few pieces of software out there that you can purchase to do this sort of stuff, but they're costly. Nonprofits shouldn't have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on software, nor should they have to try and cram their data into free software that isn't meant for them.
